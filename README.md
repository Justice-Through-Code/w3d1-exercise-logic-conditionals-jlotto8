# Snippets and Stocks

## Exercise W3D1 Logic & Conditionals

Use logic to debug code snippets and analyze how much stock you can buy

### Estimated Time to Complete

60 minutes

---

### Learning Objectives

Begin getting comfortable with conditional logic

### Assignment Overview

This assignment has two files of code! 

Follow the instructions in both `snippets.py` and `stocks.py` to complete this exercise. 

Large codebases are split up into multiple files based on what they do. We've seen this with our tests being in their own file, but it also happens when you have chunks of code that are serving different functions. Different teams follow different structures for how this works, but you'll want to get used to working in multiple files either way.

NOTE: Notice that there's a `test` _folder_ in this repo instead of just one test _file_. This allows us to run multiple files of tests at once. As long as your tests are set up correctly (in a folder called `test`, with files inside whose names start with the prefix `test`, and that has an `__init__.py` file), running `python3 -m unittest` will run ALL of your test files.

It is best practice to have your tests separated from your other code in their own folder, as seen here. This is how the repos will be set up from now on. 

DO NOT FORGET: Comment out or delete the calls to your functions -- the tests can't run with them!

## Summary

0. Accept the exercise via the GitHub Classroom link (if you're already here, you've done this part!)
1. Clone the repo to your computer
2. Follow the instructions in `snippets.py` and `stocks.py`
3. From the main folder of the exercise, run your computer's version of `python3 -m unittest` to see if your code works as expected
4. `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` your code, and look for the little green check mark on your repo that tells you your tests passed

Now you are all set!
